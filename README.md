## üåü Key Features

- **Multi-Tool Agent**: The agent is equipped with three distinct capabilities, and it intelligently chooses the right tool for the job:
  - **RAG on Financial Reports**: Upload a PDF financial report and ask complex questions about its contents.
  - **Real-time Stock Data**: Fetches up-to-the-minute stock prices and key financial metrics using the `yfinance` library.
  - **Price Prediction**: Utilizes a simple machine learning model (Linear Regression) to forecast stock prices for the next 7 days based on historical data.
- **Session-Based Interaction**: Each user interaction is managed in a unique session, ensuring that uploaded documents and conversation history are kept private and isolated.
- **Interactive Web UI**: A clean, modern chat interface built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript allows for dynamic interaction with the AI agent.
- **High-Speed Inference**: Leverages the Groq LPU‚Ñ¢ Inference Engine via `langchain-groq` for extremely fast and responsive agent actions and chat replies.
- **Robust Backend**: Built with FastAPI, providing a scalable and efficient server for handling file uploads, agent queries, and session management.
